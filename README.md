## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this blog preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

This project helped me practice HTML and CSS further and aided me in my goal to gain more experience.
In particular revisiting active/hover states and media queries was a good refresh on these topics.

In this challenge i followed the corresponding Figma design file in detail to match the design 1 to 1.
Doing this i gained insights in how to navigate Figma and extract the information i need as a web devloper.

Furthermore i practiced to outsource recurring CSS properties with the same value into independent CSS classes for reusability:

```css
.margin-bottom-sm {
  margin-bottom: 1.2rem;
}

.margin-bottom-md {
  margin-bottom: 2.4rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll be doing more projects like these - also more complex projects to gain more experience.
In particular i want to focus in writing responsive websites.
